## Problem ##
University and college students frequently experience stress, anxiety, and burnout, yet many struggle to access or engage with mental wellness resources when they need them most. Existing solutions are often:

## Hard to navigate ##
Overwhelming or text-heavy
Not personalized to how the student feels in the moment

## Primary Problems ##
Students don’t know which coping strategy is right for their emotional state
Searching for help requires time and emotional energy students may not have
Generic advice lacks personalization and emotional relevance

## Secondary Problems ##
Campus wellness resources are underutilized and long waitime 
Students delay seeking support until stress escalates

## Friction Points in the Current User Journey ##

“I don’t know what I need — I just know I’m not okay.”
“There are too many resources and I don’t know where to start.”
“I don’t want to explain everything in detail.”

## Impact if Not Solved ##
Increased burnout and emotional distress
Reduced academic performance and engagement

## Inspiration
Student Care+ was inspired by the gap between how students actually feel and how mental wellness resources are presented. Many platforms expect students to self-diagnose, read long articles, or book appointments—steps that feel overwhelming when someone is already stressed or emotionally drained. We wanted to create something that meets students where they are mentally, offering support that feels immediate, gentle, and non-judgmental rather than clinical or academic.

## How we built it

HTML/Javascript/CSS

## Challenges we ran into

At first, we went with the idea to make a student campus app, where there will be three buttons: I want to eat, I want to study, and I am stressed. 

For I want to eat, we would provide different cusines for the student to pick and decide.
For I want to study, it would pick courses that needed higher priority than others.
For I am stressed, it would provide resources on how to manage it.

We created Figma boards to explore the layout and user flow, but as we tested the idea, we ran into several challenges. After thinking about the idea more, we figured that it was not as helpful. For example, the “I want to eat” option lacked meaningful output. After selecting a food item, the student received no value in return, making the feature boring. The same issue applied to “I want to study.” Once a study priority was identified, there was no clear next step. After discussing, we decided to narrow our focus and invest more deeply in the third option, “I am stressed,” where we saw the greatest opportunity to provide real, immediate value to students. We expanded this idea into Student Care+, a web-based wellness support platform designed to help post-secondary students manage stress, anxiety, and emotional overwhelm through mindfulness resources and AI-guided recommendations.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-We sucessfully designed a web page of what our web-based wellness support platform would look like.
-Figured out which videos were the best for students
-ranslated an abstract problem (student stress) into a concrete, actionable digital solution
-Iterated on our original idea and refined our focus to create a more impactful and meaningful product

## What we learned
-Students are more likely to engage with wellness tools when they require minimal effort and explanation
-Focusing on one clear problem leads to better solutions
-Testing our idea helped us see what was useful and what was not
-Students need support that feels quick and easy, not overwhelming

## What's next for StudentCare+
We plan to complete the HTML/CSS layout, add all YouTube mindfulness videos, and make buttons and the AI-guided features fully functional. Once implemented, users will be able to seamlessly access curated resources and receive personalized support for managing stress and anxiety.
